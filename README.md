- 👀 I’m interested in building a robot for robot wars, and making a AI powered image recognition system to turn the sprinklers on in the garden to stop next door's cat sh!tting in my raised beds!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ESP32 stuff
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above
- 📫 How to reach me... probably on here tbh
